100DayDataScienceJourney: Here I Go!

#DAY1.

Excited to announce that I'm embarking on a 100-day journey to conquer the world of Data!

As part of the roadmap, I'm determined to first conquer R! üìäüöÄ

I'll be diving headfirst into the world of R programming. From a complete newbie to a data-wrangling wizard, I'm committed to learning and sharing my progress every step of the way.

Expect daily challenges, coding snippets, and real-world applications as I navigate this exciting learning adventure. Let's learn together!

Feel free to follow along on my LinkedIn and GitHub for:

Blog Posts: Detailed breakdowns of key concepts.
Project Updates: Sharing my progress on mini data projects. Ô∏è
Code Snippets & Resources: Contributing and learning from others.

Let's build something awesome together!
